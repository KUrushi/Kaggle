# Kaggle
Repository for my personal Kaggle projects.


---

Kaggle Platform is a great way to get started on some data science projects/work for people of all skill levels. There are a lot of great beginner projects that you could work on, and more advanced projects as well.

I feel like my biggest problem is that I need to break out of the trap of just endlessly watching video lectures and reading books. I need to apply my knowledge.

I'll be keeping progress of the Kaggle projects that I do here. Hopefully it'll be of help to anyone!
